# Installing the project in your machine:

[Live project](https://longvision.github.io/frontend-reactjs-exam/)

## 0- (Install node.js and npm in your machine)

Download

You’ll need to have Node >= 8.10 on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm (macOS/Linux)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

Install Node.js and npm.

## 1- Copy/Download the [Project](https://github.com/longvision/frontend-reactjs-exam) from Github

Clone this repo to your local folder with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/longvision/frontend-reactjs-exam.git`

## 2- Install the project locally

Run the following command to install 'node_modules' in your machine:

`yarn install`

## 3- Replace styles.scss local file to improve the design:

Copy the content of the file located inside of the following path: ["/node_modules/react-credit-cards/lib/styles-compiled.css"](https://github.com/longvision/frontend-reactjs-exam/blob/master/node_modules/react-credit-cards/lib/styles-compiled.css) and paste inside the same directory of your local project, replacing all the content that is located there by the one your copied above.

## 4- Run the project:

Use this command:
`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## 5- This project was done in 2 viewport width sizes: 1920px and 360px.

So when checking for those views maybe you need to enter in Google Chrome Devtools Inspector twice. (F12 on windows)
You can also select Galaxy S5 to view and inspect the project in the correct width: 360px;

## 6- Inspecting

If the viewport of 360px looks strange or not fit, restart the Chrome dev tools inspector to see it accordingly.
